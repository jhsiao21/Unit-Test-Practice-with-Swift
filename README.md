## Unit Test Practice with Swift


### Guideline

From this simple example, you will learn how to decouple messy code into an MVC architecture and write testable Models and ViewModels

This exercise includes two steps and a piece of code that requires optimization, which can be downloaded from [here.](https://github.com/jhsiao21/UnitTestPractice/releases/tag/Coupling-version)

- In the first step of decoupling, there is a testable Model available for download from  [here.](https://github.com/jhsiao21/UnitTestPractice/releases/tag/Decoupling-step-1-＆-Unit-Test-for-MoneyJudge)

- The final step of decoupling provides a testable ViewModel, also available for download from [here.](https://github.com/jhsiao21/UnitTestPractice/releases/tag/Decoupling-step-2-＆-UnitTest-for-ViewModel)
